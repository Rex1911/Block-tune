Since the emerge of electronic recording and distribution systems,artists have started finding themselve shortchanged when it comes to
remunerations and rewards.And the audience are spoilt with alternative choices to access the digital content,but most of these are either 
expensive, which has forced many to opt for illegal dowloads while encouraging piracy in the process.

The high cost of digital content can be attributed to middlemen who take hefty commissions
and end up benefiting from the expense of both artists and consumers. BlockTune, through its
innovative platform and the use of new-age technology is attempting to address the problem
by cutting out middlemen and optimizing content management and delivery. 

The BlockTune ecosystem, built using Ethereum protocol is a highly secure and transparent music
and digital content distribution platform with one-of-a-kind model that shares
100% of sale proceeds with the artist â€“ charging zero commission or processing fees. At the
same time, the platform also ensures the benefits are passed on to the users in the form of
reduced prices.
